# Time-Series-Forecast
LSTM based price forecasting model for time series analysis.


Overview

In time series forecasting, the goal is to predict future values based on previously observed data. Traditional models like ARIMA or SARIMA capture linear trends and seasonal patterns, but they struggle with non-linear dependencies.

The LSTM model overcomes this by learning both short-term and long-term dependencies directly from the data, making it ideal for complex and noisy price signals.
